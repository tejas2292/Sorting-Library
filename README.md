# Sorting Library
Consider the problem of designing and implementing a sorting library. The library will have to: 
• Sort sequences of values (numbers and strings); 
• Return an array of sorted values for each input; 
• Be available with either an optional argument or a second version to return an auxiliary array that, for each element of the main output array, records the position of that element in the input sequence; 
• The size of the input sequence to be sorted is determined by the users.

The plan for implementation of at least two different algorithms, each of which should have a sequential and a parallel solution, includes:
1. One variant implementing an algorithm among: insertion sort, bubble sort;
2. One variant implementing another algorithm among: merge sort, quicksort, radix list sort, heapsort;
3. Other variants are permissible and encouraged, for example an integration of two algorithms above.
